# use sockets and TCP, and create a chat service that allows devices to send and receive messages over a network. A scenario that me and my friend want to sent messages to each other that will be typed in the console. use python

To create a simple chat service using sockets and TCP in Python, you can use the socket library. I'll provide you with a basic example for a server and a client. You and your friend will need to run these scripts on your respective devices.

1. Server Script (run this on one device):
2. Client Script (run this on both devices):
   
Replace "SERVER_IP" in the client script with the actual IP address of the device running the server script. This chat service supports only two users at a time. Each user can type messages in the console, and they will be sent to the other user. Type "exit" to close the connection.

what I need to know about the SERVER_IP (IP address of the server device)
The SERVER_IP is the IP address of the device running the server script. It allows clients to locate and establish a connection with the server over the network. Here's what you need to know about it:

Local IP Address: If both devices (server and client) are connected to the same local network (e.g., home or office Wi-Fi), you can use the local IP address of the server device. You can find the local IP address on most systems as follows:

Windows: Open the Command Prompt and run ipconfig. The local IP address will be listed under "IPv4 Address" in the output.
